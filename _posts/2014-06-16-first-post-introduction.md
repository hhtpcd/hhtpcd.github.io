description: Introduction post on my blog/website
---

I am Harry and I am a Linux sysadmin who likes scripting, open source, automation, bouldering and books. I currently work in finance for a market leading and strong tech company. I am very interested in the software and technology that runs the global stock markets and like digging through papers on HFT and online trading algorithms.

I've put together this blog/website on Github pages initially as a way for me to document and write about the projects that I'm working on and the tools I've been researching. If it happens that anyone else reads it and gains anything from it then that is a bonus. Hopefully I will be putting together a post about setting up CoreOS cluster using QEMU/KVM on Arch Linux, OS agnostic if I can!

Otherwise, I'm currently enjoying automating anything and everything with a combination of Python, Bash, Powershell and a little bit of Javascript/NodeJS. CoreOS has also caught my attention, as has Docker so I've been learning those and creating clusters. If I could use Etcd and Fleet to manage tasks and jobs in my day to day life I would be very happy, super powerful tools. Also I've discovered bouldering, indoor climbing with no harness or helmets. A physical challenge and sometimes routes provide a good mental challenge.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by.
